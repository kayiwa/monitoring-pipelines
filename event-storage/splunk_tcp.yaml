# Description
#   The Sensu Splunk TCP Handler is a Sensu Event Handler that sends events to
#   be indexed in Splunk via a Universal Forwarder.
#
# Instructions
#   1. Add "splunk_tcp" to the "event-storage" handler set.
#
#      To create the "event-storage" handler set, please run:
#
#      $ sensuctl handler create event-storage --type set --handlers splunk_tcp
#
#      If you already have a handler set called "event-storage", please run:
#
#      $ sensuctl edit handler event-storage
#
#      NOTE: the sensuctl edit command will open your default editor; please
#      modify the "handlers" attribute by adding "splunk_tcp".
#
#   2. You will need to configure a Splunk Universal Forwarder to listen on a
#      TCP port for events from this handler.  That can be done by modifying
#      the inputs.conf and providing a configuration similar to the following:
#
#      [tcp://:7758]
#      index=sensu-events
#
#      The documentation links below include information on configuring TCP
#      inputs via the web console or CLI. 
#
#   3. Configure the socket information for this TCP handler to match the
#      configuration specified above.  It has the following defaults:
#
#      - host: localhost
#      - port: 7758
#
#   4. More configuration options are available for this plugin; please see the
#      plugin documentation for more details.
